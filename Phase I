Dataset Ideas:

1. Data from the English Premier League (EPL)
The English Premier League, contested by 20 teams, is the top division of the soccer league system in England. I am interested in looking at team data (eg. total market value of 
the team, previous home vs. away records, or average player ratings as given by FIFA) to predict the outcome of a game. 
The two data sets at https://www.kaggle.com/zaeemnalla/premier-league provide most of the data I would need.


2. Crimes in Boston Data
Crime statistics for Boston are available here: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/crime-incident-reports-august-2015-to-date-source-new-system.
It would be interesting to see where and when (what time of the day/week) most crimes occur. This data could also be combined with other datasets such as police presence in that 
particular area.

3. InstaCart Orders
The following dataset provides information about 3 million InstaCart orders:
https://tech.instacart.com/3-million-instacart-orders-open-sourced-d40d29ead6f2. This data can be used to predict future orders and study user habits and how they change with
time/season etc.
